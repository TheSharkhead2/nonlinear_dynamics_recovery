# Automated Dynamics Recovery 
This project implements a from-scratch library for automated dynamical system recovery from (noisy) data based on [SINDy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03580). 
The algorithm is robust to the type of dynamics---even for chaotic systems and systems with bifurcations---and robust to varrying levels of noise. In fact, the algorithm is robust to noise applied pre-numerical differentiation. 

In addition to the code, see the [paper](Paper/main.pdf) I wrote for an overview of the background, methods, and results from the method. Further, I gave a [presentation](Presentation/main.pdf) to my Dynamical Systems class overviewing my results.
